# Implementation prototype for the HSIC sensitivity indices on the Openturns platform
Files :
  - `HSICEstimators.py` : contains the classes associated to the HSIC estimators
  - `HSICSAWeightFunctions.py` : contains the weight function class
  - `UseCase.py` : contains few examples of how the proposed HSIC indices implementation is supposed to be used 
  - `test_v2.py` : contains a working example allowing to perform different types of sensitivity analysis on a data sample
  - `Validation.R` : contains an R code allowing to validate the results obtained with test_v2.py
  - `sample.csv` : contains the data used to validate the code.
